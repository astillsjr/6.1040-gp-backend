# response:

Of course. Based on the detailed feedback, I have created new, production-ready implementations for both the concept and its test suite.

These updated files incorporate all the recommended improvements:

1. **Refresh Token Rotation**: A new `refreshToken` action has been added for enhanced security.
2. **Password Complexity**: The `register` and `changePassword` actions now enforce strong password policies.
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: The test suite has been expanded to include negative test cases for all actions, a test for the new `refreshToken` action, and a crucial test to verify access token expiration.

Here are the complete, ready-to-use files.
