# Reviewing

**concept**: Reviewing \[User, ItemTransaction]
**purpose**: To allow users to provide feedback and ratings on completed transactions, building a foundation of trust within the community.
**principle**: After a transaction is completed, both the provider and the recipient can leave a rating and a comment about the experience, which will be visible to other users.

**state**:

* a set of Reviews with
  * a reviewer User
  * a reviewee User
  * a transaction ItemTransaction
  * a rating Number
  * a comment String
  * a createdAt Date

**actions**:

* `submitReview (reviewer: User, reviewee: User, transaction: ItemTransaction, rating: Number, comment: String): (review: Review)`
  * **requires**: The transaction must be in COMPLETED status. The reviewer must be a party to the transaction. A review must not already exist for this reviewer/transaction pair. Rating is between 1-5.
  * **effects**: Creates a new review record. A sync will then trigger a recalculation of scores in `UserProfile`.
* `editReview(review: Review, newRating: Number, newComment: String)`
  * **requires**: The user performing the action must be the `reviewer` of the `review`. The review must have been submitted within a defined time window (e.g., 72 hours).
  * **effects**: Updates the `rating` and `comment` fields of the `review`.
* `deleteReview(review: Review)`
  * **requires**: The user performing the action must be the `reviewer` of the `review`.
  * **effects**: Permanently removes the `review` record.

**notes:**

* The system should define business rules around editing or deleting reviews to prevent abuse. For example: "Reviews can only be edited by their author within 72 hours of submission. Deleting a review is permanent and may trigger a recalculation of the reviewee's score."
