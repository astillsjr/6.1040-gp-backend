# response:

As requested, here is a complete implementation based on the provided concept specification.

**Note on the Request:** The prompt asks for an implementation of `UserAuthentication`, but the provided specification is for a `UserProfile` concept. I have proceeded by assuming you intended to request an implementation for the `UserProfile` concept, as that is the specification that was provided.
