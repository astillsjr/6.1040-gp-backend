# prompt: provide me with a complete implementation for UserProfile. Make sure that it follows the correct format in TypeScript, and that it is a correct and complete implementation. Finally, evaluate the implementation and make sure there is nothing missing. I have provided you already with the concept spec in the UserProfile.md file as well as the background of how to implement cocnepts. Additionally, include all queries that you believe are needed even if not specified in the cocnept spec
