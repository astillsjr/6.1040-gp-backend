# UserProfile

**concept**: UserProfile \[User]\
**purpose**: To maintain user profile information including display name, dorm affiliation, and other public-facing details that enable community connection and item discovery.\
**principle**: If a user creates a profile with their dorm and display name, then other users can find them by dorm and see their display name when viewing items they list or when communicating with them.

**state**:

* a set of Users with
  * a displayName String
  * a dorm String
  * a bio String
  * a createdAt Date
  * a lenderScore number
  * a borrowerScoreNumber

**actions**:

* `createProfile (user: User, displayName: String, dorm: String): (profile: User)`
  * **requires**: The user must not already have a profile. The dorm must be a valid MIT dorm name.
  * **effects**: Creates a profile for the user with the provided display name and dorm, initializing scores to 0.
* `updateProfile (user: User, displayName: String, dorm: String, bio: String)`
  * **requires**: The user must have an existing profile.
  * **effects**: Updates the user's profile information.
* `updateScores (user: User, lenderScore: Number, borrowerScore: Number)`
  * **system**
    * **requires**: The user must have a profile.
    * **effects**: Updates the stored reputation scores for the user.
  * `getProfile (user: User): (displayName: String, dorm: String, bio: String, lenderScore: number, borrowerScore: number)`
    * **requires**: The user must have a profile.
    * **effects**: Returns the user's profile information.

**notes**:

* User is a generic type parameter since users are created by UserAuthentication. This concept only adds profile information to existing users.
* Dorm information is critical for the "dorm-specific visibility" feature and proximity-based recommendations.
* Display name is separate from username to allow users to present themselves differently in the community.
