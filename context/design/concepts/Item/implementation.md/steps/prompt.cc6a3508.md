# prompt: provide me with a complete implementation for Item. Make sure that it follows the correct format in TypeScript, and that it is a correct and complete implementation. Finally, evaluate the implementation and make sure there is nothing missing. I have provided you already with the concept spec in the Item.md file as well as the background of how to implement concepts. Additionally, include all queries that you believe are needed even if not specified in the concept spec
