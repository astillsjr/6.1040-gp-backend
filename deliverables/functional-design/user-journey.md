## User Journey: Student’s Experience With LocalLoop

**1. A need pops up**
<br>
A student realizes they need a graphing calculator for an exam the next day. Buying one is expensive, and borrowing from a friend isn’t an option since their friends also need their calculators.

**2. Checking LocalLoop**
<br>
They open LocalLoop and search “graphing calculator.” A few listings show up from dorms, student groups, and individual students. Each listing displays availability, location, and how many points they can earn for borrowing responsibly.

**3. Quick request and pickup**
<br>
They send a request through the app. The owner confirms within minutes, and the student picks up the calculator from a nearby drop-off spot. No stress, no waiting around.

**4. Use and return**
<br>
After the exam, they return the calculator to the same spot. LocalLoop logs the return and notifies the owner automatically.

**5. Earn points → TechCash**
<br>
Their account updates with new points, which they can later redeem for TechCash through MIT’s Office of Sustainability. It’s an extra incentive that makes the system feel rewarding and encourages continued use.

**6. Giving back to the loop**
<br>
After seeing how smooth the process was, the student decides to list a couple of items they rarely use. By adding to the pool of resources, they help make LocalLoop stronger, more reliable, and more sustainable for everyone.

**By the end of the semester, students notice something:**
<br>
They spent less money, their room has less clutter, and they're talking to more people in their dorm and around campus simply by passing items back and forth. LocalLoop feels like part of MIT culture now. It's not just an app, but the easiest way to reduce waste and help each other on campus.
