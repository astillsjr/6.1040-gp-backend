## Problem: Small nonprofits and community groups struggle to coordinate volunteers effectively

Many grassroots organizations depend on volunteers to run events, fundraisers, and outreach programs, yet their coordination processes are typically manual (relying on email chains, spreadsheets, or social media groups). This leads to several challenges:

- Difficulty tracking who has signed up for what event.
- No easy way to communicate last-minute changes.
- Limited visibility into volunteer engagement over time.
- Frustration for both coordinators and volunteers, leading to lower participation.  

The problem is not a lack of motivation but a lack of lightweight, structured digital infrastructure that fits their workflow.
