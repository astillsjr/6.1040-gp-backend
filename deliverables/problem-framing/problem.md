## Problem: Communities 

In many neighborhoods and communities, people will often buy tools or supplies, like a specific screwdriver or an exact shade of blue yarn, that they only use once or twice, while others nearby might already have what they need but have no easy way to share it. Renting from stores can be expensive and sometimes buying something in a small quantity is impossible. Sharing these items on social media, community pages, or even Craigslist is often unreliable and unorganized and it leads to a lot of useful items sitting unused. There’s no simple, community-focused system that lets people share, request, or offer tools, supplies, or small services in a safe and organized way. There is an obvious missing platform that could make it easier for people to support each other, reduce waste, and create stronger local connections.

## Problem: Inefficiency with Dormspan and Cycles of Campus Waste 
MIT students face recurring challenges when accessing short-term or low-quantity resources. Whether it’s a drill for a weekend project, a specific dongle or cable for a class assignment, a suit for a last-minute interview, or a small amount of craft material such as a particular shade of yarn or a few milliliters of wood glue, these needs are typically brief, irregular, and difficult to fulfill efficiently. Yet the default solution is often to purchase the item outright, even if it will only be used once, leading to unnecessary spending, dorm-room clutter, and avoidable waste.

Although MIT’s campus culture values collaboration and mutual support, the most common mechanism for item-sharing, Dormspam, is not suited for this type of resource exchange. Dormspam blasts request emails to large mailing lists, regardless of who is actually willing or able to lend items. This leads to several systemic issues:
- **Unstructured Requests:** There is no standard format or centralized place where students can search for or list items. Every request is free-form, inconsistent, and difficult to browse or track.
- **Inbox Saturation:** Students who have no interest in lending are repeatedly spammed with requests, leading to message fatigue and ignored emails.
- **Low Incentive for Lenders:** Sharing an item requires time, communication, coordination, and sometimes travel across campus—but lenders receive no tangible reward for their effort.
- **Fragmented Visibility:** Even when a student is willing to lend something, there’s no persistent record or inventory that others can easily discover.
- **Lost Sustainability Opportunities:** Students want to reduce waste, but the friction involved in organizing lending outweighs the environmental motivation.

As a result, large numbers of useful items remain underused across campus, even though someone nearby may have exactly what another student needs. Simultaneously, students continue to purchase rarely used items, creating cycles of overconsumption and waste.

Therefore, there is a clear need for a centralized, trusted, and easy-to-use platform that helps MIT students borrow and lend items within the campus community. The system must:
- lower barriers to finding and requesting items,
- provide incentives for lenders,
- reduce unnecessary purchases,
- improve sustainability, and
- replace inefficient Dormspam-based resource sharing with a structured, community-driven alternative.

Such a platform has the potential not only to streamline access to resources but also to reinforce MIT’s culture of collaboration through a more efficient, sustainable, and mutually beneficial system.
