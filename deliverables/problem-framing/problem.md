## Problem: Communities 

In many neighborhoods and communities, people will often buy tools or supplies, like a specific screwdriver or an exact shade of blue yarn, that they only use once or twice, while others nearby might already have what they need but have no easy way to share it. Renting from stores can be expensive and sometimes buying something in a small quantity is impossible. Sharing these items on social media, community pages, or even Craigslist is often unreliable and unorganized and it leads to a lot of useful items sitting unused. There’s no simple, community-focused system that lets people share, request, or offer tools, supplies, or small services in a safe and organized way. There is an obvious missing platform that could make it easier for people to support each other, reduce waste, and create stronger local connections.

## Problem: Inefficiency with Dormspan and Cycles of Campus Waste 
MIT students face unique resource situations:

Students frequently need to borrow items for short-term use (a drill for a project, a specific cable, a suit for an interview) or need an item (an exact shade of blue yarn, wood glue, a small amount of string) and buying these items can be very expensive and wasteful if the students only need the items for a short time or if they only need a small amount. 

The current solution is "dormspam" through which students can reach out to other students who may not be interested in any involvement. This system is unstructured (no one format to seek items), spammy (as it floods inboxes of unwilling students), and lacks incentives (lenders get nothing in return often).

Most students want to be sustainable, but the effort required to list, coordinate, and lend/share an item often outweighs the altruistic feeling. There is currently no tangible reward for being a "resource provider" in the community.

Therefore there is an obvious need for MIT students to have access to a trusted and easy way to access temporary resources without buying them, and lenders need a tangible incentive to go through the effort of sharing their inventory.
