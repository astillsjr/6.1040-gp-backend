## Comparables
Existing solutions and their shortcomings:
| Comparable | Description | Limitation |
|------------|-------------|------|
| SignUpGenius / Signup.com | Allows users to create sign-up sheets for events | Geared toward schools and small clubs; lacks role-based management or long-term tracking |
| VolunteerMatch.org | Matches volunteers with causes | Focuses on discovery, not coordination after sign-up |
| Google Sheets / Forms | Used by many small orgs for volunteer sign-ups | Not integrated; requires manual follow-up|
| Bigger CRM systems (e.g., Salesforce for Nonprofits) | Powerful volunteer tracking | Too complex and expensive for small groups |
