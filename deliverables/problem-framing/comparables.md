## Comparables

Existing solutions and their shortcomings:
| Comparable | Description | Limitation |
|------------|-------------|------|
| Olio | “The app that lets you pass on what you no longer need to people who live nearby” | Not focused on borrowing tools/supplies/services as a concept |
| Nextdoor | A neighbourhood network “connecting neighbours to the people, places, and information that matter most in their local communities” | Not built specifically for resource-sharing of tools/supplies/services as it lacks structured workflow for borrowing/offering |
| Craigslist | An online classifieds website with sections for items for sale, freebies, services, and community posts | Extremely broad and generic and no specific trust, tracking, or community-resource-sharing workflow designed for tools/supplies/skills within a local neighborhood context |
| Neighborhood Tool Library | An established neighborhood collection of items (usually tools), for the community to share together | It is a physical location without consistency/technology ensuring items are there when needed, unable to provide information that services/items that are not physically present are able to be used/borrowed |
| Facebook Marketplace "Buy Nothing, Spend Nothing" Groups | A gift economy where “people give, receive, share, lend through a worldwide network of local gift economies” | Informal and lacks structured platform features for tracking of shared/loaned/availiable items/servies |
