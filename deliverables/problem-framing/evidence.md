## Evidence

1. **Sharing economy and local sustainable sharing networks**

- The article [*“Platforms, Scales and Networks: Meshing a Local Sustainable Sharing Economy”*](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10606-019-09352-1) (2019) explores how local, relational sharing initiatives (neighborhood-based) differ from flobal sharing platforms. It finds that local sharing builds relational assests (trust, social ties) over time, which are crucial for participation. It also finds that digital infrastructure matters, and that community-oriented platforms need to adapt to local scales, not just "global marketplaces".

2. **Library of Things (LoT) / tool‑sharing models and their impact**

- A case study: [*“Sustainability Perspectives of the Sharing Economy: Process of Creating a Library of Things in Finland”*](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/11/6627) found that residents perceved the new LoT as a positive addition. The study also estimated that by avoiding manufacturing of new goods, the LoT avoided 5,752 kg CO₂ equivalent. 
- A [news article](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jun/03/vashon-washington-community-tool-library) talks about how on a rural island in Washington State, a tool library lent out 3,787 items to a population of ~11,000, showing real usage and community demand.

3. **Trust, reputation & user behavior in sharing systems**

- The paper [*“Digital Identity: The Effect of Trust and Reputation Information on User Judgement in the Sharing Economy”*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03029) finds that trust/reputation signals (digital identity, profile completeness) significantly influence user willingness to participate in sharing.

4. **Evidence on “tool libraries” as part of broader community sharing**

- The article [*“Library of Things – Why not share rather than own?”*](https://www.shareable.net/library-of-things/) describes how LoTs have grown (~2,000 worldwide) and emphasizes the dual benefits: cost‑saving for users and reduced consumption.
