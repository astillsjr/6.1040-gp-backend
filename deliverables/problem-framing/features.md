## New Features (Updated & Expanded for MIT Context)

### User roles:
- **Resource provider (Lenders):** list items, manage availability, set lending rules, track loan history, earn rewards or credits, and manage their reputation.
- **Resource seekers (Borrowers):** browse resources, request items, communicate with providers, track borrowing history, and redeem incentives.

### App features:
**Smart Item Listing & Availability System**
- Easy item listing with photos, categories, condition tags, and optional dorm-specific visibility.
- Real-time availability calendar tailored for short-term campus use.

**Intelligent Borrowing & Scheduling** 

- Scheduling for pick-up and drop-off with suggested meeting points on campus.
- Ability to borrow for hours, not just days (reflecting MIT’s short-term needs).  

**Reputation, Reliability & Trust System** 

- Borrower and lender scores based on timeliness, care of items, and responsiveness.
- Flag and review tools for misuse or damage.  

**Incentives & Rewards**

- Point-based reward system for lenders, redeemable for:
  - Priority access to high-demand items
  - Community perks (e.g., early access to limited resources)
  - Sustainability badges or recognition
- Borrowers also earn points for reliable and responsible behavior.  

**Search, Filtering, & Smart Recommendations**

- Filters by item type, dorm proximity, availability window, or urgency.
- ML-backed suggestions for “common items in your dorm” or “frequently borrowed this week.”
- Campus-specific categories (tools, interview attire, electronics adapters, materials, lab supplies safe for sharing, etc.).  

**Seamless Communication & Notifications**

- Integrated chat for coordinating pick-ups and resolving details.
- Automated reminders for upcoming returns, overdue items, or item availability changes.

**Batch Requests & Community Sourcing**
- Ability to create “micro-requests” for small quantities (e.g., “2 oz wood glue,” “3 ft of string”).
- Option to crowdsource multiple small contributions from nearby students.
- Ideal for crafting, prototyping, or one-off lab projects.

**Lost & Found + Free & Upcycle Zone**
- Add a dedicated section for items that are free, being recycled, or available for permanent transfer.
- Helps reduce campus waste cycles and encourages repurposing.
