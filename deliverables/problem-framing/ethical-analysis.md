# Ethical Analysis

## Stakeholder Identification

-  **Direct Stakeholders and Impacts**
	-  **Community Members:**
 		-  	"No buy" culture saves the stakeholder money
   		-  	Local aspect of the system saves the stakeholder time since they don't need to go out to buy items
     	-	Reduces clutter in household since community members share items
      	-	Reintroduces service sharing system by introducing services as an option and others can share what they have to exchange for it		 	
-  **Indirect Stakeholders**
	-  **Neighborhood Associations/Governing Boards:**
 		- 	Can advertise and promote this system to intice others to join the community  
	-  **Environmental Advocates:**
 		- 	Support the reduce/reuse/recycle/share aspect of app
   		-	Can help spread the word of system so others can join 	
	-  **Stores and Second-hand Marketplaces:**
 		- 	May lose sales because of new sharing platform

## VSD Insights

-  **Non-targeted Use (Stakeholders)**
	-  Possibility of adversaries entering the application and filling it with false/malicious advertisements
	-  Relates to our item listing feature
	-  Can be resolved by adding some sort of verification process or through some use of the reputation system
-  **Adaptation (Time)**
	-  Our app encourages moving away from a hoarding lifestyle and fosters community sharing
	-  Might also inspire people to become more sustainability-aware and bring that mindset over into other parts of their lifestyle
-  **Choosing Not To Use (Time)**
	-  Our app relies on being widely adopted by communities since the more items there are, the better and more useful the app is
	- Non-use not only affects the individual themselves by preventing them from interaction with their community, but also affects the community as a whole 
	-  Could maybe be addressed by adding an inviting feature or just making it more accessible over all so that the barrier of entry is not very high
-  **Environmental Sustainability (Values)**
	-  Our app supports positive environmental impacts by reducing waste in communities through encouraging the reuse of different items
	-  This can be explored through maybe some sort of metric of how many (weight) of trash has been saved or something like that
-  **Consider Children (Stakeholders)**
	-  Since we are dealing with people's possessions and items that have value, our app is not the most child-friendly
	-  However, through the use of the app with an adult, children can be taught the importance of not only lending a helping hand to your community, but also being environmentally aware
-  **Pervasiveness and Cultural Shift (Pervasiveness)**
	-  Has the potential to influence a movement/social norms to make sharing more mainstream and to reduce stigma of second-hand use
	-  Promotes a positive vibe through an app that celebrates sharing culture and the benefits of community growing
-  **Data Privacy and Trust (Values/Pervasiveness)**
	-  Since this is community based, users can deduce that other users live close to them which could pose a privacy risk
	-  We can abtract out the location and use approximate locations using zip codes or city/town names instead of direct addresses
