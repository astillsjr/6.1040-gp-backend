# Ethical Analysis

## Stakeholder Identification

-  **Direct Stakeholders and Impacts**
	-  **MIT Students:**
 		-  	MIT students are the primary target for the application as its primary goal is to organize and facilitate exchange between students.
   		-   Allows MIT student to choose whether they want to be part of this system as opposed to being forced to
     	-	Reduces both material and monetary waste by having items be reused and shared
      	-	Fosters friendly engagement and community building between students through the incentive and community-based features present	 	
-  **Indirect Stakeholders**
	-  **MIT Sustainability Leaders:**
 		- 	Able to take advantage of this system to encourage students to be more sustainable in their practices
 		-    Can partner with the application to provide real-life incentives or rewards in order to better user experience 
	-  **MIT Student Life Leaders:**
 		- 	Could see an increase in positive feedback on student life due to students having better and easier to resources, and the presence of a new structured system
   		-	  There exists the possibility of encouragement to create new systems such as this one for different aspects of student life
	-  **Stores and Second-hand Marketplaces:**
 		- 	May lose sales or incoming traffic because of new sharing platform, especially applying to marketplaces in close proximity to MIT

## VSD Insights

-  **Non-targeted Use (Stakeholders)**
	-  Possibility of adversaries entering the application and filling it with false/malicious advertisements
	-  Relates to our item listing feature
	-  This could be resolved through an inherent verification system
		- Thinking about this problem led us to coming up with the possible solution of syncing with Kerberos since this will be an MIT-exclusive system
-  **Adaptation (Time)**
	-  Our app encourages moving away from a hoarding lifestyle and fosters community sharing
	-  Might also inspire people to become more sustainability-aware and bring that mindset over into other parts of their lifestyle
	- This consideration led us to focus on the community aspect of our application by having different dorms/living communities have their own spaces within the app
-  **Choosing Not To Use (Time)**
	-  Our app relies on being widely adopted by communities since the more items there are, the better and more useful the app is
	- Non-use not only affects the individual themselves by preventing them from interaction with their community, but also affects the community as a whole 
	-  Could maybe be addressed by adding an inviting feature or just making it more accessible over all so that the barrier of entry is not very high
		- This is also addressed through out community feature and allows for the possibility of interacting with living group leadership in order to make it more accessible
-  **Environmental Sustainability (Values)**
	-  Our app supports positive environmental impacts by reducing waste in communities through encouraging the reuse of different items
	-  This can be explored through maybe some sort of metric of how many (weight) of trash has been saved or something like that
	- This is partially addressed by our incentive system that inherently fosters sustainable practices by fostering healthy motivation and competition to make use of the application
-  **Pervasiveness and Cultural Shift (Pervasiveness)**
	-  Has the potential to influence a movement/social norms to make sharing more mainstream and to reduce stigma of second-hand use
	-  Promotes a positive vibe through an app that celebrates sharing culture and the benefits of community growing
-  **Data Privacy and Trust (Values/Pervasiveness)**
	-  Since this is community based, users can deduce that other users live close to them which could pose a privacy risk
	-  By limiting our reach to MIT, this massively limits the risk as most students are comfortable with other just knowing their dorm or living group rather than their exact address
