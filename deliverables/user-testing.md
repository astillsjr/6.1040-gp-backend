## Task List

The following table lists the tasks used in the user test. Tasks are ordered so that later tasks depend on state created in earlier ones. Each task is tied to central goals of LocalLoop: reducing friction in finding items, simplifying lending, and replacing Dormspam with structured, sustainable sharing.

| Task Title | Instruction to Participant | Rationale for Inclusion |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Create an Account | “Please create a new LocalLoop account using your MIT email.” | Tests whether first-time users can easily onboard. Onboarding friction is a major barrier preventing adoption of alternatives to Dormspam. |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Set Up Your Profile | “Please add your dorm, your name, and a short bio to your profile.” | User identity and dorm location are essential for trust and logistics. Tests clarity of required fields and visibility settings. |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Browse for an Item You Need | “Please send a borrow request for any item of interest.” | Browsing/search is core to solving the ‘inefficiency of Dormspam.’ Tests whether users can navigate categorized listings, search, and filters. |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Post an Item to Lend | “Please list an Ethernet cable you own as available to lend.” | Lending is essential for sustainability and must be easy to encourage participation. Tests whether users can complete the full listing workflow. |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Log Out and Log Back In | “Please log out and then log back into your account." | Ensures the user understands session controls and can reaccess their listings/requests. Identifies potential navigational issues. |



## User Test Report

The participant completed all tasks successfully. They encountered encountered several unexpected usability concerns that revealed gaps in LocalLoop’s interaction flow. During Task 1 (Create an Account), the participant paused because they were unsure whether MIT Touchstone or a standard email/password login would be used. They verbalized: “Is this supposed to link to MIT login?” This confusion suggests an unclear gulf of execution around authentication.

In Task 2, the participant filled in profile information easily but hesitated when selecting their dorm, asking aloud whether their dorm location would be public. This reflected a gap in the gulf of evaluation—privacy implications were not clearly communicated.

The most significant friction that happened during Task 3 (Browsing) was that the user thought they could type in the dorms and was unaware of the filter we created to sort by dorms.

Task 4 (Posting an Item) proceeded smoothly except for confusion around “Condition” and “Category” dropdowns.

Finally, in Task 5, the participant had no problem logging out and in with their username and password created before.

Overall, the participant found the app promising!



## Flaws & Opportunities for Improvement


1. Unclear Authentication Expectations

Issue: Participant was unsure whether to use standard login or MIT Touchstone.

Cause: Login UI lacks labels or contextual text.

Fix: Add explicit text: “Log in with MIT Touchstone” or “Create password-based account.”


2. Ambiguous Profile Visibility Settings

Issue: Participant unsure whether their dorm would be publicly visible.

Cause: Profile section lacked explanatory text.

Fix: Add short descriptions (e.g., “Dorm visible only to borrowers/lenders you interact with”).


3. NEED ANOTHER ISSUE HERE
