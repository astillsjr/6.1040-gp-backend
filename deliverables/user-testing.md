## Task List

The following table lists the tasks used in the user test. Tasks are ordered so that later tasks depend on state created in earlier ones. Each task is tied to central goals of LocalLoop: reducing friction in finding items, simplifying lending, and replacing Dormspam with structured, sustainable sharing.

| Task Title | Instruction to Participant | Rationale for Inclusion |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Create an Account | “Please create a new LocalLoop account using your MIT email.” | Tests whether first-time users can easily onboard. Onboarding friction is a major barrier preventing adoption of alternatives to Dormspam. |
| Set Up Your Profile | “Please add your dorm, your name, and a short bio to your profile.” | User identity and dorm location are essential for trust and logistics. Tests clarity of required fields and visibility settings. |
| Browse for an Item You Need | “Please send a borrow request for any item of interest.” | Browsing/search is core to solving the ‘inefficiency of Dormspam.’ Tests whether users can navigate categorized listings, search, and filters. |
| Post an Item to Lend | “Please list an Ethernet cable you own as available to lend.” | Lending is essential for sustainability and must be easy to encourage participation. Tests whether users can complete the full listing workflow. |
| Log Out and Log Back In | “Please log out and then log back into your account." | Ensures the user understands session controls and can reaccess their listings/requests. Identifies potential navigational issues. |



## User Test Report

### User Test 1

The participant completed all tasks successfully. They encountered encountered several unexpected usability concerns that revealed gaps in LocalLoop’s interaction flow. During Task 1 (Create an Account), the participant paused because they were unsure whether MIT Touchstone or a standard email/password login would be used. They verbalized: “Is this supposed to link to MIT login?” This confusion suggests an unclear gulf of execution around authentication.

In Task 2, the participant filled in profile information easily but hesitated when selecting their dorm, asking aloud whether their dorm location would be public. This reflected a gap in the gulf of evaluation—privacy implications were not clearly communicated.

The most significant friction that happened during Task 3 (Browsing) was that the user thought they could type in the dorms and was unaware of the filter we created to sort by dorms.

Task 4 (Posting an Item) proceeded smoothly except for confusion around “Condition” and “Category” dropdowns.

Finally, in Task 5, the participant had no problem logging out and in with their username and password created before.

Overall, the participant found the app promising!

### User Test 2

Before beginning the user test, the participant was asked for their consent and given a one line description of the app's purpose. After that, the participant began to go through the tasks and explore the different user interfaces and actions that are part of LocalLoop. 

In task 1, the user found it pretty straight forward, with no real questions or comments apart from mentioning that it "looks like a pretty standard registration page" but with "less password restrictions that  \[they\] usually encounter." Following that, for task 2, they created their profile with an also confident and intuitive demeanor, only noting that they "want to change their profile picture". From these first introductory tasks, we can conclude that there is very little user friction or barrier or entry for getting started with the application. Apart from a couple of tweaks like adding MIT verification or adding a profile picture changer, the direct and non-complicated profile and register interfaces we have created seem to a smooth part of the user journey.

Following that, the user began the task of browsing and requesting to borrow an item. The user quickly found the item listings page (since they were automatically redirected), and stated that they were impressed with how clean the feed looked. After selecting an item and going to the item page, they quickly went through and filled out the corresponding fields. A quick note, they were very surprised and impressed with the time slot interafce, saying it was "very organized", but were disappointed with how  "massive the time windows are," stating how it seems a little restrictive. This part also seemed to display a little user friction, but there were times where the user hesitated or paused to think about their actions, demonstrating that this UI was nto as intuitive, especially the time selection part.

After creating a request, they were then instructed to create a post for task 4. It took a little for them to find the list button, since they "thought it would be part of the listings page," but then were a little embarrassed that the list button was at the top all along. Once again, they had little trouble filling out the corresponding fields. The primary conclusion made from this that the user did state and appear to be a little overwhelmed by the amount of fields, emphasizing that maybe there is room for simplicity. 

The user then completed task 5 with no difficulty, major comments, or concerns.

One last point to make is that when the user saw the home page, they noted how it seemed so busy and a little misleading with how many elements it had. They stated how the "purpose of the app is simple, in a good way" but "the home page seems so busy, it honestly reflects badly on the purpose" of the application. Once again, highlighting how there is room for improvement in terms of simplicity,


## Flaws & Opportunities for Improvement


1. Unclear Authentication Expectations

Issue: Participant was unsure whether to use standard login or MIT Touchstone.

Cause: Login UI lacks labels or contextual text.

Fix: Add explicit text: “Log in with MIT Touchstone” or “Create password-based account.”


2. Ambiguous Profile Visibility Settings

Issue: Participant unsure whether their dorm would be publicly visible.

Cause: Profile section lacked explanatory text.

Fix: Add short descriptions (e.g., “Dorm visible only to borrowers/lenders you interact with”).


3. Home Page Rework for Simplicity

Issue: Participant clearly stated how the home page of the site is very busy, with a lot of elements that don't serve a clear purpose, and that are a little misleading in terms of appearing like they do.

Cause: Home page displays a lot of text and some stats elements that might not be absolutely necessary. 

Fix: Rework the Home page to be more simple and functional. Some ideas for here could be to limit the amount of explanatory text or make it interactive and maybe a short "sneak-peek" feed of the current items that are listed.
