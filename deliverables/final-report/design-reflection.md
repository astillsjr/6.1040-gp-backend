# Design Reflection

The following are each member's reflection on the final project, our thoughts, comments, and what we have learned.

## Kayle Orantes

Through this final project, I was able to deepen my understanding of full-stack development and see how all the pieces of a system connect together. One of the most exciting parts for me was getting to connect our site to a real database. I had just begun learning similar skills in my 6.1850 class, so being introduced to these ideas first in 6.104 made the experience in my other class feel much more manageable. Seeing how backend logic, routes, and data storage all interact gave me a clearer picture of how real applications are structured.

Another major takeaway for me was learning how to break down a large problem in a group setting. Our team spent a lot of time on calls working through the code together, figuring out how to approach different pieces of the project, and deciding how to divide responsibilities in a way that made sense. This collaborative process helped me understand not only the technical side of the project, but also the communication and coordination that go into building software as a team.

Overall, I really enjoyed this class and felt that the teachings prepared me well to handle both the technical challenges and the design thinking required for a project of this scope.

Through this project, and class overall, I have been able to learn so many new things about software development and design. My biggest learning takeaway was in concept design. This second group project not only allowed me to have more experience with designing concepts, but since this had a bigger scope, I also was able to learn about how to make them more functional, modular, and of more use. Particularly, with the help of our TA Iris, I believe I gained a way better understanding of what separates a good concept design from one that is not as effective. For example, I now have a way better grasp of how concepts should not be driven or based on features, but rather "elements"  of our design that have the ability to be used across multiple features. Another big takeaway for me was the use of frontend-backend interactions, APIs, and requests. Before this project and the individual one, I had very little knowledge on the backend interacts with the frontend, what routes should be exposed, and how secure app design works, so this project allowed me to gain more experience on that since the scope and range of our APIs and concepts was so much larger.  Finally, I learned a lot about how to properly design software in a team setting: how to separate responsibilities, bounce ideas off each other, and leverage each other's expertise in order to fill gaps in my own. Overall this final project pushed me to learn about good practices in many different aspects of software design, and I had a great time building this application.
