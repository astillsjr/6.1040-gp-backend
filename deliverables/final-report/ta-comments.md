# Comments for our TA

We were able to implement most of the core functionality we planned for LocalLoop, including user-to-user interactions, item browsing, notifications, and the main backend routes. There were just a few features that didn’t fully make it into the final version:

- **Rewards System:**  
  We completed the backend structure for rewards, but didn’t have time to finish the frontend interface. This was an extra feature we hoped to include if time allowed.

- **Reviewing and Flagging:**  
  These features have a backend and tests completed, but we decided to focus on other perfecting other routes for the full user journey to be complete.

- **Notifications:**  
  Notifications were fully implemented in the final version.

Overall, we focused our efforts on polishing the core user experience, and we’re happy with how much we were able to complete. If we had a little more time, the rewards UI would have been the next feature added.

Thanks Iris!!
