## Deliverables Associated With Each Meeting


## Agenda
- Meeting scheduled for **November 13 at 12:30 PM**.

### Progress Report
- Coming up with lots of ideas.
- Focused on the BeaverBite concept to replace MIT’s current free-foods mailing list system.

### Design Changes
- None at the moment.
- Still generating ideas for what the site could look like.

### Issues
- Unsure if BeaverBite meets the project requirements because of this feedback:
  - Many features feel generic and non-specific; unclear what sets the app apart.
  - Need fewer, stronger, more targeted features rather than many weaker ones.
  - Unclear user incentives: why post? why lend items? why choose this over dormspam or group chats?
  - Need clearer user flows for different stakeholders (lender vs. borrower).
  - Should lean into the community aspect more strongly—how does the app actually build community?
  - Consider limiting to MIT users; must articulate the benefit of the app over existing systems.

### Plans & Decisions
- Continue brainstorming.
- Reevaluate whether BeaverBite can be improved to meet requirements or whether a new concept is needed.




## Agenda
- Meeting scheduled for **November 20 at 12:30 PM**.

### Progress Report
- Focusing on the LocalLoop idea as an MIT community application.
- Users will be able to post items to borrow or give away.

### Design Changes
- Big conceptual jump from BeaverBite.
- Still exploring the scope of the project within this new idea.

### Issues
- Still uncertain whether the idea is gamified enough.

### Plans & Decisions
- Setting up the Browse Items page.
- Beginning to allow users to interact with each other.



## Agenda
- Meeting scheduled for **December 4 at 12:30 PM**.

### Progress Report
- Last week went really well.
- Notifications are now in place.
- We worked faster than originally expected.
- Created the foundation for the rewards system, which now needs to be populated with finalized point values.

### Design Changes
- Updated the look and feel of LocalLoop to better reflect its identity (shifted primary color from red to green to emphasize sustainability).
- Added more sync points and cleaned up the entire user journey—from account creation/log-in, to listing an item, to accepting a request.
- Further developed the initial communication interaction to provide a clearer user experience.

### Issues
- Communication flow needs more thorough testing.
- Points system is only partially set up; final point values have not yet been determined.

### Plans & Decisions
- Continued emphasis on testing, with good progress so far.
- Plan to keep user-testing internally (the three of us), stopping at each issue encountered along the user journey to refine and resolve it.
