# Final Design Summary

Since our initial design, from problem framing to concept design, the feel, function, and features of LocalLoop have gone through many iterations. However, we are confident and satisfied with the final product we have delivered, believing it to be a functional and purposeful application.

The primary changes that have been made since the original proposal have been in relation to our concept design and project scope. Starting with concept design, thanks to our TA Iris, we were able to rework our initial designs into more modular, functional, and less complex concepts that serve multiple purposes across our backend. The explicit changes can be found in the differences between [concept-design](../functional-design/concept-design.md) and [updated-concept-design](../functional-design/updated-concept-design.md). However, the main changes we would like to highlight how we evolved all of our item concepts into more modular and functional concepts that can be used in combination with each other to create our main features of listing and transferring items. Instead of having concepts separated by feature of action, we pivoted to concepts like [Item](../../design/concepts/Item/Item.md) and [ItemListing](../../design/concepts/ItemListing/ItemListing.md) that have more modular states that allow us to use them in multiple features at once. Other changes include the fact that although we implemented backend infrastructure for reviewing and flagging, we were not able to implement them fully due to unexpected roadblocks in our frontend-backend interactions and a lack of time. Unfortunately, we also were not able to implement our Rewards concept due to similar reasons. However, even without these features, our application still fulfills its purpose of allowing students to exchange and borrow items through a self-contained hub that facilitates all interactions.

Our frontend also has made important changes that we made since our initial design and UI mocks. The whole appearance and UI/UX elements of our frontend went through many iterations, currently arriving at what we have now. Initially, we envisioned a frontend that had many features and that was maybe a little too complicated for the purpose of our application. However, after many discussions and user testing (both internal and external), we decided to match our our project's sustainable and simple purpose with a straightforward and friendly UI. An example of this is how we now only have four primary tabs, as opposed to the many more we originally planned (such as having a 'dorm' tab). A highlight of a change we made was the creation of the Activity tab, which allows for a user to manage all of their transactions in a simple and compact UI that is easy to navigate and understand. Once again, we believe to have iterated in an effective and satisfying manner to the current frontend we have now.

Overall, we made many changes to out initial design that have allowed us to create a project that functionally fulfills our initial design goals and purpose.
