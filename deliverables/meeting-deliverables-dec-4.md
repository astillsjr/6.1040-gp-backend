## Deliverables Associated With Each Meeting

### Agenda
- Meeting scheduled for **December 4 at 12:30 PM**.

### Progress Report
- Last week went really well.
- Notifications are now in place.
- We worked faster than originally expected.
- Created the foundation for the rewards system, which now needs to be populated with finalized point values.

### Design Changes
- Updated the look and feel of LocalLoop to better reflect its identity (shifted primary color from red to green to emphasize sustainability).
- Added more sync points and cleaned up the entire user journey—from account creation/log-in, to listing an item, to accepting a request.
- Further developed the initial communication interaction to provide a clearer user experience.

### Issues
- Communication flow needs more thorough testing.
- Points system is only partially set up; final point values have not yet been determined.

### Plans & Decisions
- Continued emphasis on testing, with good progress so far.
- Plan to keep user-testing internally (the three of us), stopping at each issue encountered along the user journey to refine and resolve it.
