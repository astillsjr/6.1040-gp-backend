## Current Progress

Thanks to the feedback that we received from our TA Iris, we reworked our concepts in order to make them more modular while retaining the core functionality and features of our project. As such, for this checkpoint we have completed the core features of our app, those being the ones dealing with listing and conducting transactions with items, as well as the structural user concepts. For these features, we have completed the backend concept implementation, testing suites, and syncs, along with a working frontend.  

## Remaining Tasks

The remaining tasks that we have are the rest of the functionality for our application. The main features that are left to complete are our reviewing system (which includes our reviewing and flagging concepts), our rewards/incentive system, and the supporting features of notifications and communication. To reflect the changes we have made to our concept specs, we have updated our timeline. A quick note to make is that we determined that making our communication/messaging feature a stretch goal is probably the best course of action, since it might be really complex to implement, and that time might be better spent on improving the rest of the project.

## Development Changes

The primary development changes have been in the form of our updated concept specs which we have linked to here:
