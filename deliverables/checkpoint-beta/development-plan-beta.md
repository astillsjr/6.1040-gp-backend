## Current Progress

Following feedback from our TA, Iris, we reworked several of our concepts to make them more modular and maintainable while preserving the core functionality of our project. As a result, we have completed all foundational features for this checkpoint. This includes:

- Core item listing and transaction functionalities

- Structural user-related concepts

- Backend concept implementations

- Comprehensive testing suites and syncs

- A functioning frontend supporting these features

These elements now form a solid base for the remaining feature development.



## Remaining Tasks

The next phase of work centers on completing the remaining application features. These include:

Reviewing System: Review creation, display, and flagging mechanisms

Rewards & Incentives: Finalizing point logic and user benefit structure

Notifications: Finalizing integrating alerts for key user actions and updates

Communication Feature (Revised): Originally a stretch goal, but now we aim to improve and stabilize the existing communication functionality, ensuring reliability and better alignment with user needs

New Request Page: Adding a dedicated Request Page alongside the existing List Item page to streamline how users request needed items

These additions reflect updates to our concept specs and help align our app toward a more complete and intuitive user experience.


## Development Changes

The primary development changes have been in the form of our updated concept specs which we have linked to here:
