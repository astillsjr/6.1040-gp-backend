## Team Contract

As a team, we agree to work together respectfully and communicate clearly throughout the project. Our goal is to stay organized, support each other, and make sure everyone contributes equally.

**Expected Level of Achievement and Effort:**  
We all aim to do high-quality work and earn an A on this project. Each of us plans to put in consistent effort every week and stay on top of our tasks so no one feels overloaded at the end.

**Personal Goals:**  
Each team member wants to both do well in the class and learn something meaningful from this project. We want to improve our coding skills, practice good teamwork, and build something we’re proud of.

**Team Meetings:**  
We’ll meet at least once a week for about an hour, either in person on campus or over Zoom if needed. We’ll also communicate regularly through our text gc for quick updates.

**Quality of Work:**  
We’ll review each other’s code before merging changes to make sure everything is clean, consistent, and works correctly. If needed, we’ll do short pair programming sessions to fix tricky bugs or discuss design choices.

**Task Assignment and Deadlines:**  
We’ll divide tasks fairly based on interest and workload. Everyone is responsible for meeting their deadlines. If someone falls behind, they’ll let the team know early so we can adjust and help out.

**Decision Making and Conflict Resolution:**  
We’ll make decisions by talking through options and agreeing as a group. If disagreements come up, we’ll handle them calmly and respectfully, focusing on what’s best for the project rather than individual opinions.

Overall, our goal is to collaborate openly, stay accountable, and make this a positive experience for everyone on the team.
