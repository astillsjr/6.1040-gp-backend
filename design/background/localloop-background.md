## Problem: Inefficiency with Dormspan and Cycles of Campus Waste 
MIT students face recurring challenges when accessing short-term or low-quantity resources. Whether it’s a drill for a weekend project, a specific dongle or cable for a class assignment, a suit for a last-minute interview, or a small amount of craft material such as a particular shade of yarn or a few milliliters of wood glue, these needs are typically brief, irregular, and difficult to fulfill efficiently. Yet the default solution is often to purchase the item outright, even if it will only be used once, leading to unnecessary spending, dorm-room clutter, and avoidable waste.

Although MIT’s campus culture values collaboration and mutual support, the most common mechanism for item-sharing, Dormspam, is not suited for this type of resource exchange. Dormspam blasts request emails to large mailing lists, regardless of who is actually willing or able to lend items. This leads to several systemic issues:
- **Unstructured Requests:** There is no standard format or centralized place where students can search for or list items. Every request is free-form, inconsistent, and difficult to browse or track.
- **Inbox Saturation:** Students who have no interest in lending are repeatedly spammed with requests, leading to message fatigue and ignored emails.
- **Low Incentive for Lenders:** Sharing an item requires time, communication, coordination, and sometimes travel across campus—but lenders receive no tangible reward for their effort.
- **Fragmented Visibility:** Even when a student is willing to lend something, there’s no persistent record or inventory that others can easily discover.
- **Lost Sustainability Opportunities:** Students want to reduce waste, but the friction involved in organizing lending outweighs the environmental motivation.

As a result, large numbers of useful items remain underused across campus, even though someone nearby may have exactly what another student needs. Simultaneously, students continue to purchase rarely used items, creating cycles of overconsumption and waste.

Therefore, there is a clear need for a centralized, trusted, and easy-to-use platform that helps MIT students borrow and lend items within the campus community. The system must:
- lower barriers to finding and requesting items,
- provide incentives for lenders,
- reduce unnecessary purchases,
- improve sustainability, and
- replace inefficient Dormspam-based resource sharing with a structured, community-driven alternative.

Such a platform has the potential not only to streamline access to resources but also to reinforce MIT’s culture of collaboration through a more efficient, sustainable, and mutually beneficial system.

## Domain: Campus Sustainability

This project operates within the domain of the sharing economy within MIT. The domain intersects sustainability (reducing the "move-out day" waste mountain), student economy (reducing costs for students), and behavioral gamification (using financial and social incentives to drive sustainable actions). By restricting the domain to MIT, we leverage existing trust infrastructures (kerberos for system registration and access) and physical proximity (dorm clusters) to solve logistics and trust hurdles that plague open-market platforms.

## New Features (Updated & Expanded for MIT Context)

### User roles:
- **Resource provider (Lenders):** list items, manage availability, set lending rules, track loan history, earn rewards or credits, and manage their reputation.
- **Resource seekers (Borrowers):** browse resources, request items, communicate with providers, track borrowing history, and redeem incentives.

### App features:
**Smart Item Listing & Availability System**
- Easy item listing with photos, categories, condition tags, and optional dorm-specific visibility.
- Real-time availability calendar tailored for short-term campus use.

**Intelligent Borrowing & Scheduling** 

- Scheduling for pick-up and drop-off with suggested meeting points on campus.
- Ability to borrow for hours, not just days (reflecting MIT’s short-term needs).  

**Reputation, Reliability & Trust System** 

- Borrower and lender scores based on timeliness, care of items, and responsiveness.
- Flag and review tools for misuse or damage.  

**Incentives & Rewards**

- Point-based reward system for lenders, redeemable for:
  - Priority access to high-demand items
  - Community perks (e.g., early access to limited resources)
  - Sustainability badges or recognition
- Borrowers also earn points for reliable and responsible behavior.  

**Search, Filtering, & Smart Recommendations**

- Filters by item type, dorm proximity, availability window, or urgency.
- ML-backed suggestions for “common items in your dorm” or “frequently borrowed this week.”
- Campus-specific categories (tools, interview attire, electronics adapters, materials, lab supplies safe for sharing, etc.).  

**Seamless Communication & Notifications**

- Integrated chat for coordinating pick-ups and resolving details.
- Automated reminders for upcoming returns, overdue items, or item availability changes.

**Community Dashboard**

- Dorm-level leaderboards to encourage friendly competition in sustainability and participation.

**Batch Requests & Community Sourcing**
- Ability to create “micro-requests” for small quantities (e.g., “2 oz wood glue,” “3 ft of string”).
- Option to crowdsource multiple small contributions from nearby students.
- Ideal for crafting, prototyping, or one-off lab projects.

**Lost & Found + Free & Upcycle Zone**
- Add a dedicated section for items that are free, being recycled, or available for permanent transfer.
- Helps reduce campus waste cycles and encourages repurposing.
